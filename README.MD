# WARNING
# VistaUIFramework will be archived on January 14 2020.
VistaUI was a framework designed to add Win7/Vista support to Windows program, the core of the VistaUI was the skeuomorphic visuals of the UI components.

Why I'm ending VistaUI? Windows 7 is the last Windows version that uses skeuomorphism for the user interface and icons, and VistaUIFramework was designed to help developers to add the Aero look to their software. But, unfortunately Microsoft will end Windows 7 support on January 14 2020 and then the Wuindows 7 market share will drop, so VistaUIFramework will become pretty useless.

However, the framework WON'T be deleted, it will be archived, so you can still use VistaUI in your programs, but it won't be supported so I won't solve any issues and there won't be any updates.

Now the good news! I'm working on a project that will help developers (web, software, mobile, etc.) to make their programs look good with fully customizable UI components (skeuomorphism, flat, material, custom, etc.) for websites, software, mobile apps, etc.

# What is VistaUIFramework
VistaUI is a framework based on WinForms and .NET Framework for developing .NET Applications using Vista and 7 features, like arrow-splitted buttons, command links, vista-style controls and etc.

## No P/Invoke or WinAPI knowledge required
Stop trying to learn Windows API to learn p/invoke to make vista controls. Let VistaUI do the work for you.

## Windows Vista and later features for WinForms
.NET Framework and Windows Forms does not replace Windows API at 100%, not even the visual styles. The lack of features is one of the biggest cons. Get the most out of Windows by using VistaUIFramework instead of learning P/Invoke.

## The Windows Vista and 7 look into your program
Make your application look like a Windows Vista/7 program. You won't stop looking at your program.

## Don't spend your time developing custom controls
Developing custom controls like `CommandLink`, `SplitButton` or `ProgressBar` is time-consuming and delays the release date of any project. Use VistaUIFramework instead of reinventing the wheel and start developing.

# IMPORTANT
The source code is often under development and may be buggy. We recommend to check out the latest release and download the .DLL file for a stable version, if you need to download the source code, go to Releases and download the source code as zip.

# Download the stable release
Stable releases are available on .DLL files.<br>
Minimum requirements:
* .NET Framework 2.0 or later.
* Windows Vista or later

## Where do I find the 1.x versions
Since 2016, VistaUIFrameowork 1.0 was launched in VB.NET with fewer features and p/invoke usage. C# had x1000 times more support than VB.NET so VistaUIFramework was rewritten from scratch using C# and the whole repository was deleted and re-created.
